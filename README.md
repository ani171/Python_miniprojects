## Hangman

Created a simple Hangman game in Python. The program prompts the user to enter their name, welcomes them to play Hangman with the word "Metallica," and allows them to guess characters. The player has 10 lives to guess the word correctly. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the progress and outcome.
